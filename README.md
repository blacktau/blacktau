# Hello 👋

I'm Sean, a software engineer in the UK. I focus primarily on full-stack web but have been known to dabble in command line and desktop applications.

- 🚜 My best known ecosystems are dotnet which I've been working in since 2005.
- 🏠 I've also worked extensively in javascript, typescript and react.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning rust and would like to learn svelte and previously learned some go.
- 🎮 Occasionally I dip into game development godot.
